    "Abstraction in OOPs is the process of hiding the implementation details of a system and only exposing the essential features and functionalities to the users. It is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that helps in creating more modular, flexible, and maintainable code. By using abstraction, we can separate the implementation details of a system from its interface, making it easier to change and maintain the system over time. Additionally, abstraction helps in creating more modular and reusable code, which can be used in different parts of an application or even in different applications altogether."

    "**abc module:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The 'abc' module in Python stands for \"Abstract Base Classes\". It provides a way to define abstract classes in Python, which are classes that cannot be instantiated directly and must be subclassed to be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 'abc' module provides a 'ABC' class that can be used as a base class for defining abstract classes. To define an abstract method, you can use the '@abstractmethod' decorator. Any subclass that does not implement an abstract method defined in the base class will also be considered an abstract class and cannot be instantiated directly.\n",

    "\n",
    "# use-cases of abc module:\n",
    "\n",
    "The abc module in Python is used for defining and working with abstract base classes (ABCs). ABCs are classes that cannot be instantiated on their own but are meant to be subclassed by other classes that provide concrete implementations for their abstract methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Here are some reasons why the abc module is commonly used in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code reuse:**\n",
    "Abstract base classes can define common interfaces for related classes, which can simplify code reuse and make it easier to write generic code that works with different classes that implement the same interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Polymorphism:** By defining abstract base classes, you can take advantage of polymorphism in your code. You can write code that operates on an abstract base class and is able to work with any concrete implementation of that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Documentation:** Abstract base classes can provide a clear and concise way to document the expected interface of a class or a module. By defining abstract methods and properties, you can clearly communicate what a class is supposed to do and what its requirements are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the abc module is a useful tool for designing flexible and maintainable code in Python, and it is widely used in many libraries and frameworks"
